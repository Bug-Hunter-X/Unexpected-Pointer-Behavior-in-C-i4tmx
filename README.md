This repository contains a simple C program that highlights an important concept in C programming: pointer manipulation and its impact on memory. The `bug.c` file demonstrates the unexpected behavior that can arise from changing where a pointer points, which can easily lead to subtle and hard-to-find bugs. The `bugSolution.c` provides a detailed explanation and illustrates a more robust way to handle pointers to avoid these pitfalls.
